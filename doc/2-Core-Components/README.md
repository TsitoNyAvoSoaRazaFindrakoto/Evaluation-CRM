# Core Components of ASP.NET Core MVC

## Overview
This section provides in-depth coverage of the fundamental components that make up an ASP.NET Core MVC application:

1. [Models](01-Models/README.md)
   - Domain Models
   - View Models
   - Data Annotations
   - Model Binding
   - Validation

2. [Controllers](02-Controllers/README.md)
   - Action Methods
   - Routing
   - Filters
   - Results
   - API Controllers

3. [Views](03-Views/README.md)
   - Razor Syntax
   - Layouts
   - Partial Views
   - View Components
   - Tag Helpers

4. [Data Flow](04-Data-Flow/README.md)
   - Request Pipeline
   - Model Binding
   - View Resolution
   - Response Generation

## Component Interaction
The core components work together in a coordinated fashion:

1. Request Handling:
   - Request arrives at the application
   - Routing system determines the appropriate controller and action
   - Controller action is executed

2. Data Processing:
   - Controller works with models
   - Business logic is applied
   - Data is prepared for presentation

3. Response Generation:
   - Controller selects a view
   - View renders the model data
   - Response is sent back to the client

## Best Practices
- Keep controllers thin
- Use view models for complex views
- Implement proper validation
- Follow REST conventions
- Use dependency injection
