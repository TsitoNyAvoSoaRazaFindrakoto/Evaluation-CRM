# Data Flow in ASP.NET MVC

Data flow in ASP.NET MVC describes how data moves between different components of the application, from client requests to server responses.

## Core Concepts

- [Data Validation](./04-Data-Flow/02-Data-Validation.md)
- [State Management](./04-Data-Flow/03-State-Management.md)
- [Data Transfer Objects](./04-Data-Flow/04-DTOs.md)

## Overview

The data flow in ASP.NET MVC follows these general steps:
1. Client sends request with data
2. Model binding processes incoming data
3. Data validation occurs
4. Controller processes the data
5. Data is passed to views or returned as response

See the specific sections for detailed information about each aspect of data flow.
