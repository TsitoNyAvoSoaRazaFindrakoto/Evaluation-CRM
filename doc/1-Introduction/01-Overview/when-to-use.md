# When to Use ASP.NET Core MVC

## Use Cases for MVC

### 1. Large-Scale Web Applications
✅ **Ideal When:**
- Building enterprise applications
- Managing complex business logic
- Requiring structured architecture
- Working with large development teams

❌ **Consider Alternatives When:**
- Building simple, single-page applications
- Creating microservices with minimal UI
- Developing API-only services

### 2. Server-Side Rendering Requirements
✅ **Perfect For:**
- SEO-critical applications
- Content-heavy websites
- Applications requiring fast initial page loads
- Progressive enhancement scenarios

```csharp
// Example: Server-side rendering with dynamic SEO metadata
public class ProductController : Controller
{
    public IActionResult Details(int id)
    {
        var product = _productService.GetById(id);
        ViewBag.Title = product.Name;
        ViewBag.Description = product.MetaDescription;
        return View(product);
    }
}
```

### 3. Team and Development Context
✅ **Best When:**
- Team has .NET expertise
- Existing .NET infrastructure
- Need for Visual Studio tooling
- Requiring integrated testing

### 4. Technical Requirements
✅ **Choose MVC When Needing:**
- Form processing
- File uploads
- Complex validation
- Session management
- Server-side state management

Example validation scenario:
```csharp
public class OrderViewModel
{
    [Required]
    [StringLength(100)]
    public string CustomerName { get; set; }

    [Required]
    [EmailAddress]
    public string Email { get; set; }

    [CreditCard]
    public string CardNumber { get; set; }

    [Required]
    [Range(0.01, double.MaxValue)]
    public decimal TotalAmount { get; set; }
}
```

## Alternatives to Consider

### 1. Razor Pages
✅ **Consider When:**
- Building smaller applications
- Needing simpler page-focused routing
- Working with CRUD operations
- Having less complex UI interactions

### 2. Minimal APIs
✅ **Better Choice When:**
- Building microservices
- Creating simple REST APIs
- Needing minimal overhead
- Focusing on performance

Example Minimal API:
```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
var app = builder.Build();

app.MapGet("/api/products", async (IProductService service) =>
    await service.GetAllAsync());

app.Run();
```

### 3. Blazor
✅ **Consider When:**
- Building rich interactive UIs
- Needing real-time updates
- Wanting to share code with client
- Preferring C# over JavaScript

## Decision Matrix

| Requirement                  | MVC | Razor Pages | Minimal APIs | Blazor |
|----------------------------|-----|-------------|--------------|--------|
| Complex Business Logic     | ✅   | ⚠️          | ❌            | ✅      |
| SEO Requirements          | ✅   | ✅          | ❌            | ⚠️      |
| Team .NET Experience      | ✅   | ✅          | ✅            | ✅      |
| Rapid Development        | ⚠️   | ✅          | ✅            | ⚠️      |
| API-First Development    | ⚠️   | ❌          | ✅            | ❌      |
| Rich UI Interactions     | ⚠️   | ❌          | ❌            | ✅      |
| Scalability             | ✅   | ✅          | ✅            | ✅      |
| Learning Curve          | ⚠️   | ✅          | ✅            | ⚠️      |

## Migration Considerations

### From Traditional Web Forms
Benefits of migrating to MVC:
- Better separation of concerns
- Modern development practices
- Improved testability
- Better performance

### From Single Page Applications
Consider MVC when:
- SEO is becoming critical
- Reducing client-side complexity
- Improving initial load times
- Simplifying state management

## Best Practices When Choosing MVC

1. **Evaluate Project Scale**
   - Consider team size
   - Assess complexity
   - Review maintenance requirements

2. **Consider Performance Requirements**
   - Server-side rendering needs
   - Caching requirements
   - Scalability expectations

3. **Assess Team Capabilities**
   - .NET expertise
   - Front-end skills
   - Testing experience

4. **Review Business Requirements**
   - SEO needs
   - Time to market
   - Budget constraints
